# Adaptive Cruise Control System
This project serves as my bachelor's thesis, and it was conducted under the guidance of Professor Valcher. Its primary objective is to replicate the functionality of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system based on the knowledge and resources available to me during the project's development.
The project employs a basic gain scheduling adaptive control to model the behavior of the ACC system.
The project has been entirely developed in italian.
